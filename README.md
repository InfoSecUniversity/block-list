# block-list
Use at your own risk and there's no warranty. The following block list were found as malwre, bad websites, and scanning networks externally. These list could present a false positive because I don't
monitor if the IP and/or URL gets cleaned up. So please as your own risk and dosn't offer any warranty. Most of these Items came from a SIEM.

If you find an issue with any of the url's or IPs in any of the list. Please start a new issue here. https://github.com/InfoSecUniversity/block-list/issues
